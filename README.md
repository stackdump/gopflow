# gopetri

go library for PetriNets encoded using pflow schema.

Goal is to be compatible with http://www.pneditor.org/

# Status

Work in progress

# Motivation

Pflow seems to be a easier to work with compared with [PNML](http://www.pnml.org/)

Support for Sub-nets and Roles in pflow seem to extend elementary petri-nets just enough to be useful.
